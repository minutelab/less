// With nodejs we have a limitations on the communication with the runtime container:
// When the lambda function is actually running we shouldn't have any event waiting in the node event loop.
// This is because that as long as there are events, the lambda function won't finish running
//
// When sending event information over stdin, I wasn't able to completly remove events from the event loop,
// so the solution was to send the events over http. But we cannot send back the events on http,
// because then we have a connection open while the lambda function is running.
// So we send an empty reply immediatly from node, and on the go side we close the connection.
//
// Then when we have a reply we send it on stdout. So we end up with a strangly mixed protocol, but it work
